# Hi, I'm j_a_g_e_n_t_i_c 👋

**AI Layer-Slayer

I'm transitioning into AI/ML sales/solutions/engineering with a focus on building intelligent automation, content platforms, and privacy-conscious developer tools. I leverage AI augmentation in my workflow and build production-ready applications across web, mobile, and data pipelines.

## 🎯 Current Focus

- **AI-Powered Content Platforms**: Quiz game shows with automated curation and real-time features
- **Privacy-First Tools**: Local-first data storage, client-side processing, zero-tracking analytics
- **iOS Development**: SwiftUI apps with AI integration and real-time audio/video features
- **Data Pipelines**: Python-based automation for content ingestion, transformation, and delivery

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python, TypeScript, Swift, JavaScript
**Frontend:** React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, SwiftUI
**Backend/Data:** Node.js, SQLite, IndexedDB (Dexie.js)
**AI/ML:** OpenAI API (GPT-4o), prompt engineering, agent orchestration
**DevOps:** GitHub Actions, fastlane, Xcode Cloud
**Tools:** VS Code, Xcode, Claude Code, git

## 💡 Philosophy

> "Aggravations ∈ Opportunity"

I believe friction points are feature requests in disguise. My approach combines cutting-edge AI tools with battle-tested engineering practices to build systems that solve real problems while respecting user privacy and data sovereignty.
